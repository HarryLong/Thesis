\chapter{Background} \label{chap:background}

This chapter gives an overview of previous work related to our topic. Procedural methods applied to computer graphics is a wide area of research with an exhaustive number of publications. As a consequence, we cannot pretend to review all this work. Instead, we will focus on research which is closely linked to the generation of virtual rural worlds. \\

Our work will not focus on modelling terrain relief but rather terrain content. As a consequence, material focused on procedurally generating terrain will not be reviewed. In this chapter will focus on the two primary constituents of rural terrains: water and vegetation.
