\chapter{Background}

This chapter gives an overview of previous work related to our topic. Procedural methods applied to computer graphics is a wide area of research with an exhaustive number of publications. As a consequence, we cannot pretend to review all this work. Instead, we will focus on reviewing work which is closely linked to generating virtual \textit{rural} worlds. \\

We first present research which deals with the procedural generation of terrains. This will be followed by a review of methods to generate water flows on terrains. To conclude, an overview of techniques to generate vegetation will be presented.
