abstract = {Many clustering schemes have been proposed for ad hoc networks. A systematic classification of these clustering schemes enables one to better understand and make improvements. In mobile ad hoc networks, the movement of the network nodes may quickly change the topology resulting in the increase of the overhead message in topology maintenance. Protocols try to keep the number of nodes in a cluster around a pre-defined threshold to facilitate the optimal operation of the medium access control protocol. The clusterhead election is invoked on-demand, and is aimed to reduce the computation and communication costs. A large variety of approaches for ad hoc clustering have been developed by researchers which focus on different performance metrics. This paper presents a survey of different clustering schemes.},

In this paper, we describe a three-steps method that produces a terrain mesh using ridge lines and rivers drainage network. As opposed to previous methods that compute water erosion for a given terrain model --- Digital Elevation Map ---, our terrain mesh is generated constrained by a precomputed set of ridge lines and rivers network. A skeleton of a ridges and rivers network is computed and stored in a Digital Elevation Map (D.E.M.) as initial values. Then, the elevations data set is enriched using a novel interpolation method based on a Midpoint Displacement's Inverse process. Finally, a midpoint displacement subdivision is applied to interpolate the remaining elevation coordinates. The resulting terrain meshes lead to naturalistic landscape models and our method seems to be very promising. Images produced by our model are presented.},

abstract = {The study of plant development requires increasingly powerful modeling tools to help understand and simulate the growth and functioning of plants. In the last decade, the formalism of L-systems has emerged as a major paradigm for modeling plant development. Previous implementations of this formalism were made based on static languages, i.e., languages that require explicit definition of variable types before using them. These languages are often efficient but involve quite a lot of syntactic overhead, thus restricting the flexibility of use for modelers. In this work, we present an adaptation of L-systems to the Python language, a popular and powerful open-license dynamic language. We show that the use of dynamic language properties makes it possible to enhance the development of plant growth models: (i) by keeping a simple syntax while allowing for high-level programming constructs, (ii) by making code execution easy and avoiding compilation overhead, (iii) by allowing a high-level of model reusability and the building of complex modular models, and (iv) by providing powerful solutions to integrate MTG data-structures (that are a common way to represent plants at several scales) into L-systems and thus enabling to use a wide spectrum of computer tools based on MTGs developed for plant architecture. We then illustrate the use of L-Py in real applications to build complex models or to teach plant modeling in the classroom.},

It is known that these iterative techniques are especially sensitive to initial starting conditions. We present a procedure for computing a refined starting condition from a given initial one that is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. The refined initial starting condition allows the iterative algorithm to converge to a "better" local minimum. The procedure is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for both discrete and continuous data. We demonstrate the application of this method to the popular K-Means clustering algorithm and show that refined inital starting points indeed lead to improved solutions. Refinement run time is considerably lower than the time required to cluster the full database. The method is scalable and can be coupled with a scalable clustering algorithm to address the large-scale clustering problems in data mining.},

Commonly, procedu- ral models are applied to generate the corresponding models and let users experience a wide variety of new environments. Existing algorithms generate landscapes immediately with view-dependent resolution and without preprocessing. Unfortunately, landscapes generated by such algorithms lack river networks and therefore appear unnatural. Algorithms that integrate realistic river networks are computationally expensive and cannot be used to generate a locally adaptive high resolution landscape during a fly-through. In this paper, we propose a novel al- gorithm to generate realistic river networks. Our procedural algorithm creates complete planets and landscapes with realistic river networks within seconds. It starts with a coarse base geometry of a planet without further preprocessing and user intervention. By exploiting current graphics hardware, the proposed algorithm is able to generate adaptively refined landscape geometry during fly-throughs},

Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives. This enables us to show landscapes faithfully using only a limited percentage of primitives. In addition, a hierarchical data structure allows us to smoothly reduce the geometrical representation to any desired number of primitives. The scene is hierarchically divided into local portions of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects. This allows us to maintain the visual fidelity of the representation while reducing most of the geometry drastically.

abstract = {Modeling and rendering of natural scenes with thousands of plants poses a number of problems. The terrain must be modeled and plants must be distributed throughout it in a realistic manner, reflecting the interactions of plants with each other and with their environment. Geometric models of individual plants, consistent with their po- sitions within the ecosystem, must be synthesized to populate the scene. The scene, whichmay consist of billions of primitives, must be rendered efficiently while incorporating the subtleties of lighting in a natural environment. We have developed a system built around a pipeline of tools that address these tasks. The terrain is designed using an interactive graphical editor. Plant distribution is determined by hand (as one would dowhen designing a garden), by ecosystem simulation, or by a combination of both techniques. Given parametrized procedural models of individual plants, the geometric complexity of the scene is reduced by approximate instancing, in which similar plants, groups of plants, or plant organs are replaced by instances of representative objects before the scene is rendered. The paper includes examples of visually rich scenes synthesized using the system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modelling plant growth allows us to test hypotheses and carry out virtual experiments concerning plant growth processes that could otherwise take years in field conditions. The visualization of growth simulations allows us to see directly and vividly the outcome of a given model and provides us with an instructive tool useful for agronomists and foresters, as well as for teaching. Functional-structural (FS) plant growth models are nowadays particularly important for integrating biological processes with environmental conditions in 3-D virtual plants, and provide the basis for more advanced research in plant sciences.

SCOPE: In this viewpoint paper, we ask the following questions. Are we modelling the correct processes that drive plant growth, and is growth driven mostly by sink or source activity? In current models, is the importance of soil resources (nutrients, water, temperature and their interaction with meristematic activity) considered adequately? Do classic models account for architectural adjustment as well as integrating the fundamental principles of development? Whilst answering these questions with the available data in the literature, we put forward the opinion that plant architecture and sink activity must be pushed to the centre of plant growth models. In natural conditions, sinks will more often drive growth than source activity, because sink activity is often controlled by finite soil resources or developmental constraints. PMA06: This viewpoint paper also serves as an introduction to this Special Issue devoted to plant growth modelling, which includes new research covering areas stretching from cell growth to biomechanics. All papers were presented at the Second International Symposium on Plant Growth Modeling, Simulation, Visualization and Applications (PMA06), held in Beijing, China, from 13-17 November, 2006. Although a large number of papers are devoted to FS models of agricultural and forest crop species, physiological and genetic processes have recently been included and point the way to a new direction in plant modelling research.},

abstract = {Procedural methods offer an automated means of generating complex cityscapes, incorporating the placement of park areas and the layout of roads, plots and buildings. Unfortunately, existing interfaces to procedural city systems tend to either focus on a single aspect of city layout (such as the road network) ignoring interaction with other elements (such as building dimensions) or expect numeric input with little visual feedback, short of the completed city, which may take up to several minutes to generate. In this paper we present an interface to procedural city generation, which, through a combination of sketching and gestural input, enables users to specify different land usage (parkland, commercial, residential and industrial), and control the geometric attributes of roads, plots and buildings. Importantly, the inter-relationship of these elements is pre-visualized so that their impact on the final city layout can be predicted. Once generated, further editing, for instance shaping the city skyline or redrawing individual roads, is supported. In general, City Sketching provides a powerful and intuitive interface for designing complex urban layouts.},

Composed of curve-like strokes, we describe elements by a concise set of perceptually relevant fea- tures. After detecting appearance dominant traits, we can gener- ate new arrangements that respect the captured appearance-related spatial statistics usingmultitype point processes.

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In k-means clustering, we are given a set of n data points in d-dimensional space Rd and an integer k and the problem is to determine a set of k points in Rd, called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation},

Four slopes, with different gradients (25{\%}, 33{\%}, 40{\%}, and 50{\%}) were constructed. Each slope was divided into four plots with different coversoil thicknesses (0 cm, 15 cm, 30 cm, and 45 cm).  Soil loss increased with slope gradients up to 40{\%} and decreased as slope gradient increased to 50{\%}. During the first two growing seasons, plant biomass was significantly correlated (r = 0.65 and 0.70, respectively) to increases in coversoil thickness; however, increases in plant production did not reduce soil loss. Results from this study indicated that RUSLE v. 1.06 was an effective long-term planning tool to use on steep slopes.},

The network patterns contain information that is characteristic of the landscape's topographic features. It is therefore possible to create an approximation to natural terrain by simulating the erosion of stream networks on an initially uneroded surface. Empirical models of stream erosion were used us a basis for the model presented here. Stream networks of various sizes and shapes are created by the model from a small number of initial parameters. The eroded surface is represented as a surface under tension, using the tension parameter to shape the profiles of valleys created by the stream networks. The model can be used to generate terrain databases for flight simulation and computer animation applications.},

abstract = {Contemporary 3D games are often situated within large urban environments. This necessitates a time-consuming and expensive content creation process involving the modelling of vast amounts of geometric detail: including terrain, roads, buildings, and other as- sociated features. We present a system called Citygen that aims to automate as much of this as possible by employing procedural generation methods to rapidly create the urban geometry typical of a modern city. Procedural methods have long been used within the graphics and game development communities to generate natural phenomena such as plants and trees. We employ these methods to generate the underlying road networks that form the structure of cities and urban neighbourhoods. These road networks are automatically mapped to any supplied terrain model, and adapt themselves to the specific geometry of the underlying terrain. Building footprints are automatically extracted from the resulting model and buildings can then be inserted either procedurally or by hand. Our system is unique in that it is designed to allow developers hands- on interactive control over the generation process. We achieve this by providing an interface allowing the user to directly manipulate geometric elements such as road intersection nodes, and to directly control and specify many aspects of the procedural generation. The results are updated in real time, thus facilitating an interactive design process.},

In this paper, we focus on the coarse aspect of modeling, the specification of plant distribution. We consider two classes of models: localtoglobal models, rooted in the individualbased ecosystem simulations, and inverse, globaltolocal models, in which positions of individual plants are inferred from a given distribution of plant densities. We extend previous results obtained using both classes of models with additional phenomena, including clustering and succession of plants. We also introduce the formalism of multiset Lsystems to formalize the individualbased simulation models.},

abstract = {Most landscapes are covered by some type of vegetation, therefore digital modelling of vegetation is a prerequisite for three-dimensional landscape visualisation. Vegetation can be modelled either at the level of individual plants or as a terrain texture. At object scale, plants can be described by a set of rules which define the shape of its individual parts (stems, leafs, flowers, etc.) as well as their configuration and temporal development. Some applications available for planners are based on botanical models, such as L-grammar [Development models of multicellular organisms: a computer graphics perspective. In: Langton, E.C. (Ed.), Artificial Life. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1988, p. 221] or the AMAP system [J. Biosci. 17 (3) (1992) 275]. The use of this approach often yields very large files and requires powerful computing equipment. Other applications aim at an optimisation of the rendering speed by using simplified, more symbolic objects. At landscape scale, vegetation is often described as a texture of the terrain. This can be done by simple image mapping or by three-dimensional texture mapping techniques, such as bump mapping, displacement mapping or particle emission mapping. The most difficult scale level is the one between object and landscape scale, where both approaches have to be combined in order to optimise the visual quality as well as the processing speed. In the market, an increasing number of plant visualisation systems is now available. Selection criteria from the point of view of planning practice should not only include aspects of rendering quality, but also aspects of integration with standard applications at object and landscape scale, such as CAD, GIS, DBMS, and terrain modelling. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In standard fractal terrain models based on fractional Brownian motion the statistical character of the surface is, by design, the same everywhere. A new approach to the synthesis of fractal terrain height fields is presented which, in contrast to previous techniques, features locally independent control of the frequencies composing the surface, and thus local control of fractal dimension and other statistical characteristics. The new technique, termed noise synthesis, is intermediate in difficulty of implementation, between simple stochastic subdivision and Fourier filtering or generalized stochastic subdivision, and does not suffer the drawbacks of creases or periodicity. Varying the local crossover scale of fractal character or the fractal dimension with altitude or other functions yields more realistic first approximations to eroded landscapes. A simple physical erosion model is then suggested which simulates hydraulic and thermal erosion processes to create gloabl stream/valley networks and talus slopes. Finally, an efficient ray tracing algorithm for general height fields, of which most fractal terrains are a subset, is presented.},

Existing synthesis algorithms can only generate white or blue-noise distri- butions with characteristics dictated by the underlying processes used, and analysis tools have not been focused on exploring rela- tions among distributions. We propose a unified analysis and gen- eral synthesis algorithms for point distributions. We employ the pair correlation function as the basis of our methods and design synthesis algorithms that can generate distributions with given tar- get characteristics, possibly extracted from an example point set, and introduce a unified characterization of distributions by map- ping them to a space implied by pair correlations. The algorithms accept example and output point sets of different sizes and dimen- sions, are applicable to multi-class distributions and non-Euclidean domains, simple to implement and run in O(n) time. We illustrate applications of our method to real world distributions.},

Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

Two main interaction modes are described, for specifying the landscape and terrain features, respectively.

abstract = {With the ever increasing costs of manual content creation for virtual worlds, the potential of creating it automatically becomes too attractive to ignore. However, for most designers, traditional procedural content generation methods are complex and unintuitive to use, hard to control, and generated results are not easily integrated into a complete and consistent virtual world. We introduce a novel declarative modeling approach that enables designers to concentrate on stating what they want to create instead of on describing how they should model it. It aims at reducing the complexity of virtual world modeling by combining the strengths of semantics-based modeling with manual and procedural approaches. This article describes two of its main contributions to procedural modeling of virtual worlds: interactive procedural sketching and virtual world consistency maintenance. We discuss how these techniques, integrated in our modeling framework SketchaWorld, build up to enable designers to create a complete 3D virtual world in minutes. Procedural sketching provides a fast and more intuitive way to model virtual worlds, by letting designers interactively sketch their virtual world using high-level terrain features, which are then procedurally expanded using a variety of integrated procedural methods. Consistency maintenance guarantees that the semantics of all terrain features is preserved throughout the modeling process. In particular, it automatically solves conflicts possibly emerging from interactions between terrain features. We believe that these contributions together represent a significant step towards providing more user control and flexibility in procedural modeling of virtual worlds. It can therefore be expected that by further reducing its complexity, virtual world modeling will become accessible to an increasingly broad group of users. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract = {Because of the increasing detail and size of virtual worlds, designers are more and more urged to consider employing procedural methods to alleviate part of their modeling work. However, such methods are often unintuitive to use, difficult to integrate, and provide little user control, making their application far from straightforward. In our declarative modeling approach, designers are pro- vided with a more productive and simplified virtual world modeling workflow that matches better with their iterative way of working. Using interactive procedural sketching, they can quickly layout a virtual world, while having proper user control at the level of large terrain features. However, in practice, designers require a finer level of control. Integrating procedural techniques with manual editing in an iterative modeling workflow is an important topic that has remained relatively unaddressed until now. This paper identifies challenges of this integration and discusses approaches to combine these methods in such a way that designers can freely mix them, while the virtual world model is kept consistent during all modifications. We conclude that overcoming the challenges mentioned, for ex- ample in a declarative modeling context, is instrumental to achieve the much desired adoption of procedural modeling in mainstream virtual world modeling.

The growth model, based on a physiological analysis, essentially simulates the internal function of the plant, and has been validated against measured biological data with excellent results. We show how to account for the influence of light through photosynthesis, and thereby incorporate the effects of a given plant’s immediate environment on its architecture, shape and size. Since biological matter is controlled by water transpiration and received radiant enery, the model requires efficient and accurate simulation of radiant energy exchanges. We describe a complete lighting simulation system tailored for the difficult case of plants, by adapting state-of-the-art techniques such as hierarchical instanciation for radiosity and general BRDF modeling. Our results show that (a) our lighting simulation system ef- ficiently provides the required information at the desired level of accuracy, and (b) the plant growth model is extremely well calibrated against real plants and (c) the combined system can simulate many interesting growth situations with direct feedback from the environment on the plant’s charac- teristics. Applications range from landscape simulation to agronomical and agricultural studies, and to the design of virtual plants responding to their environment.},

Areas where the motion is slow become more eroded by the dissolution erosion, whereas in the areas with faster motion, the force-based erosion prevails. Second, when the water under-erodes certain areas, slippage takes effect and the river banks fall into the water. A variety of local and global editing operation is provided. The user has a great level of control over the process and receives immediate feedback since the GPU-based erosion simulation runs at least at 20 fps on off-the-shelf computers for scenes with grid resolution of 2048×1024 and four layers of material. We also present a divide and conquer approach to handle large terrain erosion, where the terrain is tiled, and each tile calculated inde- pendently on the GPU.We show a wide variety of erosion-based modeling features such as forming rivers, drying flooded areas, rain, interactive manipulation with rivers, spring, adding obstacles into the water, etc.},

abstract = {K-means clustering is a widely used tool for cluster analysis due to        its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its        performance can be distorted when clustering high-dimensional data        where the number of variables becomes relatively large and many of        them may contain no information about the clustering structure. This        article proposes a high-dimensional cluster analysis method via        regularized k-means clustering, which can simultaneously cluster        similar observations and eliminate redundant variables. The key idea        is to formulate the k-means clustering in a form of regularization,        with an adaptive group lasso penalty term on cluster centers. In order       to optimally balance the trade-off between the clustering model        fitting and sparsity, a selection criterion based on clustering        stability is developed. The asymptotic estimation and selection        consistency of the regularized k-means clustering with diverging        dimension is established. The effectiveness of the regularized k-means       clustering is also demonstrated through a variety of numerical        experiments as well as applications to two gene microarray examples.        The regularized clustering framework can also be extended to the        general model-based clustering. },

@article{Teoh2008,
abstract = {The erosive action of rivers and seas has immense influence on the appearance of the physical landscape. However, the creation of several important river and coastal features are not available in terrain creation software and systems. We have designed algorithms to easily create these features, namely (1) river meanders, (2) river deltas, (3) coastal beaches. A terrain that does not have these features the looks unnatural. WaterWorld is a user-directed automatic terrain generation tool that we have designed. Similar to existing methods, it allows users to create mountains, canyons, rivers and seas. Its novelty is the inclusion of tools to create meanders, deltas, beaches and cliffs, to obtain a more realistic terrain.},

@article{Vanhoey2013,
abstract = {In computer graphics, rendering visually detailed scenes is often achieved through texturing. We propose a method for on-the-fly non-periodic infinite texturing of surfaces based on a single image. Pattern repetition is avoided by defining patches within each tex- ture whose content can be changed at runtime. In addition, we consistently manage multi-scale using one input image per repre- sented scale. Undersampling artifacts are avoided by accounting for fine-scale features while colors are transferred between scales. Eventually, we allow for relief-enhanced rendering and provide a tool for intuitive creation of height maps. This is done using an ad- hoc local descriptor that measures feature self-similarity in order to propagate height values provided by the user for a few selected texels only. Thanks to the patch-based system, manipulated data are compact and our texturing approach is easy to implement on GPU. The multi-scale extension is capable of rendering finely detailed tex- tures in real-time.},

@article{Zhang2011,
abstract = {Compared to 2D textures, solid textures can represent not only the bounding surfaces, but also their interiors. Existing solid texture synthesis methods pay little attention to the generation of conforming textures that capture geometric structures or reflect the artists' design intentions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to synthesizing solid textures using 2D exemplars. The generated textures locally agree with a tensor field derived from user sketching curves. We use a deterministic approach and only a small portion of the voxels needs to be synthesized on demand. Correction is fundamental in deterministic texture synthesis. We propose a history windows representation, which is general enough to unifiedly represent various previous correction schemes, and a dual grid scheme based on it to significantly reduce the dependent voxels while still producing high quality results. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces significantly improved solid textures with a small amount of user interaction. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},
