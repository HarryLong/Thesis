abstract = {Many clustering schemes have been proposed for ad hoc networks. A systematic classification of these clustering schemes enables one to better understand and make improvements. In mobile ad hoc networks, the movement of the network nodes may quickly change the topology resulting in the increase of the overhead message in topology maintenance. Protocols try to keep the number of nodes in a cluster around a pre-defined threshold to facilitate the optimal operation of the medium access control protocol. The clusterhead election is invoked on-demand, and is aimed to reduce the computation and communication costs. A large variety of approaches for ad hoc clustering have been developed by researchers which focus on different performance metrics. This paper presents a survey of different clustering schemes.},

Using this methodology, we present in this work a realization of such a process with beech tree forest. For this, we propose to use a stochastic tree distribution method based on gibbs process. A key contribution of this work is to take into account crown plasticity during the distribution by considering asymetric crown shapes. 1.},

abstract = {The study of plant development requires increasingly powerful modeling tools to help understand and simulate the growth and functioning of plants. In the last decade, the formalism of L-systems has emerged as a major paradigm for modeling plant development. Previous implementations of this formalism were made based on static languages, i.e., languages that require explicit definition of variable types before using them. These languages are often efficient but involve quite a lot of syntactic overhead, thus restricting the flexibility of use for modelers. In this work, we present an adaptation of L-systems to the Python language, a popular and powerful open-license dynamic language. We show that the use of dynamic language properties makes it possible to enhance the development of plant growth models: (i) by keeping a simple syntax while allowing for high-level programming constructs, (ii) by making code execution easy and avoiding compilation overhead, (iii) by allowing a high-level of model reusability and the building of complex modular models, and (iv) by providing powerful solutions to integrate MTG data-structures (that are a common way to represent plants at several scales) into L-systems and thus enabling to use a wide spectrum of computer tools based on MTGs developed for plant architecture. We then illustrate the use of L-Py in real applications to build complex models or to teach plant modeling in the classroom.},

Commonly, procedu- ral models are applied to generate the corresponding models and let users experience a wide variety of new environments. Existing algorithms generate landscapes immediately with view-dependent resolution and without preprocessing. Unfortunately, landscapes generated by such algorithms lack river networks and therefore appear unnatural. Algorithms that integrate realistic river networks are computationally expensive and cannot be used to generate a locally adaptive high resolution landscape during a fly-through. In this paper, we propose a novel al- gorithm to generate realistic river networks. Our procedural algorithm creates complete planets and landscapes with realistic river networks within seconds. It starts with a coarse base geometry of a planet without further preprocessing and user intervention. By exploiting current graphics hardware, the proposed algorithm is able to generate adaptively refined landscape geometry during fly-throughs},

Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives. This enables us to show landscapes faithfully using only a limited percentage of primitives. In addition, a hierarchical data structure allows us to smoothly reduce the geometrical representation to any desired number of primitives. The scene is hierarchically divided into local portions of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects. This allows us to maintain the visual fidelity of the representation while reducing most of the geometry drastically. With our system, we are able to interactively render very complex landscapes with good visual quality},

abstract = {Modeling and rendering of natural scenes with thousands of plants poses a number of problems. The terrain must be modeled and plants must be distributed throughout it in a realistic manner, reflecting the interactions of plants with each other and with their environment. Geometric models of individual plants, consistent with their po- sitions within the ecosystem, must be synthesized to populate the scene. The scene, whichmay consist of billions of primitives, must be rendered efficiently while incorporating the subtleties of lighting in a natural environment. We have developed a system built around a pipeline of tools that address these tasks. The terrain is designed using an interactive graphical editor. Plant distribution is determined by hand (as one would dowhen designing a garden), by ecosystem simulation, or by a combination of both techniques. Given parametrized procedural models of individual plants, the geometric complexity of the scene is reduced by approximate instancing, in which similar plants, groups of plants, or plant organs are replaced by instances of representative objects before the scene is rendered. The paper includes examples of visually rich scenes synthesized using the system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modelling plant growth allows us to test hypotheses and carry out virtual experiments concerning plant growth processes that could otherwise take years in field conditions. The visualization of growth simulations allows us to see directly and vividly the outcome of a given model and provides us with an instructive tool useful for agronomists and foresters, as well as for teaching. Functional-structural (FS) plant growth models are nowadays particularly important for integrating biological processes with environmental conditions in 3-D virtual plants, and provide the basis for more advanced research in plant sciences.

SCOPE: In this viewpoint paper, we ask the following questions. Are we modelling the correct processes that drive plant growth, and is growth driven mostly by sink or source activity? In current models, is the importance of soil resources (nutrients, water, temperature and their interaction with meristematic activity) considered adequately? Do classic models account for architectural adjustment as well as integrating the fundamental principles of development? Whilst answering these questions with the available data in the literature, we put forward the opinion that plant architecture and sink activity must be pushed to the centre of plant growth models. In natural conditions, sinks will more often drive growth than source activity, because sink activity is often controlled by finite soil resources or developmental constraints. PMA06: This viewpoint paper also serves as an introduction to this Special Issue devoted to plant growth modelling, which includes new research covering areas stretching from cell growth to biomechanics. All papers were presented at the Second International Symposium on Plant Growth Modeling, Simulation, Visualization and Applications (PMA06), held in Beijing, China, from 13-17 November, 2006. Although a large number of papers are devoted to FS models of agricultural and forest crop species, physiological and genetic processes have recently been included and point the way to a new direction in plant modelling research.},

Unfortunately, existing interfaces to procedural city systems tend to either focus on a single aspect of city layout (such as the road network) ignoring interaction with other elements (such as building dimensions) or expect numeric input with little visual feedback, short of the completed city, which may take up to several minutes to generate. In this paper we present an interface to procedural city generation, which, through a combination of sketching and gestural input, enables users to specify different land usage (parkland, commercial, residential and industrial), and control the geometric attributes of roads, plots and buildings. Importantly, the inter-relationship of these elements is pre-visualized so that their impact on the final city layout can be predicted. Once generated, further editing, for instance shaping the city skyline or redrawing individual roads, is supported. In general, City Sketching provides a powerful and intuitive interface for designing complex urban layouts.},

The capture of an artist’s style by the sole posterior analysis of his/her achieved draw- ing poses a formidable challenge. Such by-example techniques could become one of the most intuitive tools for users to allevi- ate creation process efforts. Here, we propose to tackle this issue from a statistical point of view and take specific care of accounting for information usually overlooked in previous research, namely the elements’ very appearance. Composed of curve-like strokes, we describe elements by a concise set of perceptually relevant fea- tures. After detecting appearance dominant traits, we can gener- ate new arrangements that respect the captured appearance-related spatial statistics usingmultitype point processes. Ourmethod faith- fully reproduces visually similar arrangements and relies on neither heuristics nor post-processes to ensure statistical correctness.},

The user draws several 2D freeform strokes interactively on the screen and the system automatically constructs plausible 3D polygonal surfaces. Our system supports several modeling operations, including the operation to construct a 3D polygonal surface from a 2D silhouette drawn by the user: it inflates the region surrounded by the silhouette making wide areas fat, and narrow areas thin. Teddy, our prototype system, is implemented as a Java™ program, and the mesh construction is done in real-time on a standard PC.

Four slopes, with different gradients (25\%, 33\%, 40\%, and 50\%) were constructed. Each slope was divided into four plots with different coversoil thicknesses (0 cm, 15 cm, 30 cm, and 45 cm).  Soil loss increased with slope gradients up to 40\% and decreased as slope gradient increased to 50\%. During the first two growing seasons, plant biomass was significantly correlated (r = 0.65 and 0.70, respectively) to increases in coversoil thickness; however, increases in plant production did not reduce soil loss. Results from this study indicated that RUSLE v. 1.06 was an effective long-term planning tool to use on steep slopes.},

abstract = {Contemporary 3D games are often situated within large urban environments. This necessitates a time-consuming and expensive content creation process involving the modelling of vast amounts of geometric detail: including terrain, roads, buildings, and other as- sociated features. We present a system called Citygen that aims to automate as much of this as possible by employing procedural generation methods to rapidly create the urban geometry typical of a modern city. Procedural methods have long been used within the graphics and game development communities to generate natural phenomena such as plants and trees. We employ these methods to generate the underlying road networks that form the structure of cities and urban neighbourhoods. These road networks are automatically mapped to any supplied terrain model, and adapt themselves to the specific geometry of the underlying terrain. Building footprints are automatically extracted from the resulting model and buildings can then be inserted either procedurally or by hand. Our system is unique in that it is designed to allow developers hands- on interactive control over the generation process. We achieve this by providing an interface allowing the user to directly manipulate geometric elements such as road intersection nodes, and to directly control and specify many aspects of the procedural generation. The results are updated in real time, thus facilitating an interactive design process.},

For example, in twolevel models, plant distributions may be determined using coarse plant representations, and realistic visualizations may be obtained by substituting detailed plant models for the coarse ones. In this paper, we focus on the coarse aspect of modeling, the specification of plant distribution. We consider two classes of models: localtoglobal models, rooted in the individualbased ecosystem simulations, and inverse, globaltolocal models, in which positions of individual plants are inferred from a given distribution of plant densities. We extend previous results obtained using both classes of models with additional phenomena, including clustering and succession of plants. We also introduce the formalism of multiset Lsystems to formalize the individualbased simulation models.},

abstract = {Most landscapes are covered by some type of vegetation, therefore digital modelling of vegetation is a prerequisite for three-dimensional landscape visualisation. Vegetation can be modelled either at the level of individual plants or as a terrain texture. At object scale, plants can be described by a set of rules which define the shape of its individual parts (stems, leafs, flowers, etc.) as well as their configuration and temporal development. Some applications available for planners are based on botanical models, such as L-grammar [Development models of multicellular organisms: a computer graphics perspective. In: Langton, E.C. (Ed.), Artificial Life. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1988, p. 221] or the AMAP system [J. Biosci. 17 (3) (1992) 275]. The use of this approach often yields very large files and requires powerful computing equipment. Other applications aim at an optimisation of the rendering speed by using simplified, more symbolic objects. At landscape scale, vegetation is often described as a texture of the terrain. This can be done by simple image mapping or by three-dimensional texture mapping techniques, such as bump mapping, displacement mapping or particle emission mapping. The most difficult scale level is the one between object and landscape scale, where both approaches have to be combined in order to optimise the visual quality as well as the processing speed. In the market, an increasing number of plant visualisation systems is now available. Selection criteria from the point of view of planning practice should not only include aspects of rendering quality, but also aspects of integration with standard applications at object and landscape scale, such as CAD, GIS, DBMS, and terrain modelling. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We propose a unified analysis and gen- eral synthesis algorithms for point distributions. We employ the pair correlation function as the basis of our methods and design synthesis algorithms that can generate distributions with given tar- get characteristics, possibly extracted from an example point set, and introduce a unified characterization of distributions by map- ping them to a space implied by pair correlations. The algorithms accept example and output point sets of different sizes and dimen- sions, are applicable to multi-class distributions and non-Euclidean domains, simple to implement and run in O(n) time.

In particular, we introduce procedural sketching, a novel paradigm which allows designers to quickly specify and see the effects of their procedural modelling operations, and describe its main features as implemented in our prototype system SketchaWorld. Two main interaction modes are described, for specifying the landscape and terrain features, respectively. Our approach automatically fits all generated terrain features with their surroundings, for example by smoothing out rough terrain for roads, or creating a bridge to cross a river.

abstract = {With the ever increasing costs of manual content creation for virtual worlds, the potential of creating it automatically becomes too attractive to ignore. However, for most designers, traditional procedural content generation methods are complex and unintuitive to use, hard to control, and generated results are not easily integrated into a complete and consistent virtual world. We introduce a novel declarative modeling approach that enables designers to concentrate on stating what they want to create instead of on describing how they should model it. It aims at reducing the complexity of virtual world modeling by combining the strengths of semantics-based modeling with manual and procedural approaches. This article describes two of its main contributions to procedural modeling of virtual worlds: interactive procedural sketching and virtual world consistency maintenance. We discuss how these techniques, integrated in our modeling framework SketchaWorld, build up to enable designers to create a complete 3D virtual world in minutes. Procedural sketching provides a fast and more intuitive way to model virtual worlds, by letting designers interactively sketch their virtual world using high-level terrain features, which are then procedurally expanded using a variety of integrated procedural methods. Consistency maintenance guarantees that the semantics of all terrain features is preserved throughout the modeling process. In particular, it automatically solves conflicts possibly emerging from interactions between terrain features. We believe that these contributions together represent a significant step towards providing more user control and flexibility in procedural modeling of virtual worlds. It can therefore be expected that by further reducing its complexity, virtual world modeling will become accessible to an increasingly broad group of users. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

@article{Smelik,
abstract = {Because of the increasing detail and size of virtual worlds, designers are more and more urged to consider employing procedural methods to alleviate part of their modeling work. However, such methods are often unintuitive to use, difficult to integrate, and provide little user control, making their application far from straightforward. In our declarative modeling approach, designers are pro- vided with a more productive and simplified virtual world modeling workflow that matches better with their iterative way of working. Using interactive procedural sketching, they can quickly layout a virtual world, while having proper user control at the level of large terrain features. However, in practice, designers require a finer level of control. Integrating procedural techniques with manual editing in an iterative modeling workflow is an important topic that has remained relatively unaddressed until now. This paper identifies challenges of this integration and discusses approaches to combine these methods in such a way that designers can freely mix them, while the virtual world model is kept consistent during all modifications. We conclude that overcoming the challenges mentioned, for ex- ample in a declarative modeling context, is instrumental to achieve the much desired adoption of procedural modeling in mainstream virtual world modeling.

abstract = {We present a new model for plant growth simulation, taking into account the eco- physiological processes driving plant development with unprecedented fidelity. The growth model, based on a physiological analysis, essentially simulates the internal function of the plant, and has been validated against measured biological data with excellent results. We show how to account for the influence of light through photosynthesis, and thereby incorporate the effects of a given plant’s immediate environment on its architecture, shape and size. Since biological matter is controlled by water transpiration and received radiant enery, the model requires efficient and accurate simulation of radiant energy exchanges. We describe a complete lighting simulation system tailored for the difficult case of plants, by adapting state-of-the-art techniques such as hierarchical instanciation for radiosity and general BRDF modeling. Our results show that (a) our lighting simulation system ef- ficiently provides the required information at the desired level of accuracy, and (b) the plant growth model is extremely well calibrated against real plants and (c) the combined system can simulate many interesting growth situations with direct feedback from the environment on the plant’s charac- teristics. Applications range from landscape simulation to agronomical and agricultural studies, and to the design of virtual plants responding to their environment.},

abstract = {K-means clustering is a widely used tool for cluster analysis due to        its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its        performance can be distorted when clustering high-dimensional data        where the number of variables becomes relatively large and many of        them may contain no information about the clustering structure. This        article proposes a high-dimensional cluster analysis method via        regularized k-means clustering, which can simultaneously cluster        similar observations and eliminate redundant variables. The key idea        is to formulate the k-means clustering in a form of regularization,        with an adaptive group lasso penalty term on cluster centers. In order       to optimally balance the trade-off between the clustering model        fitting and sparsity, a selection criterion based on clustering        stability is developed. The asymptotic estimation and selection        consistency of the regularized k-means clustering with diverging        dimension is established. The effectiveness of the regularized k-means       clustering is also demonstrated through a variety of numerical        experiments as well as applications to two gene microarray examples.        The regularized clustering framework can also be extended to the        general model-based clustering. },

abstract = {In computer graphics, rendering visually detailed scenes is often achieved through texturing. We propose a method for on-the-fly non-periodic infinite texturing of surfaces based on a single image. Pattern repetition is avoided by defining patches within each tex- ture whose content can be changed at runtime. In addition, we consistently manage multi-scale using one input image per repre- sented scale. Undersampling artifacts are avoided by accounting for fine-scale features while colors are transferred between scales. Eventually, we allow for relief-enhanced rendering and provide a tool for intuitive creation of height maps. This is done using an ad- hoc local descriptor that measures feature self-similarity in order to propagate height values provided by the user for a few selected texels only. Thanks to the patch-based system, manipulated data are compact and our texturing approach is easy to implement on GPU. The multi-scale extension is capable of rendering finely detailed tex- tures in real-time.},

abstract = {Compared to 2D textures, solid textures can represent not only the bounding surfaces, but also their interiors. Existing solid texture synthesis methods pay little attention to the generation of conforming textures that capture geometric structures or reflect the artists' design intentions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to synthesizing solid textures using 2D exemplars. The generated textures locally agree with a tensor field derived from user sketching curves. We use a deterministic approach and only a small portion of the voxels needs to be synthesized on demand. Correction is fundamental in deterministic texture synthesis. We propose a history windows representation, which is general enough to unifiedly represent various previous correction schemes, and a dual grid scheme based on it to significantly reduce the dependent voxels while still producing high quality results. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces significantly improved solid textures with a small amount of user interaction. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},
