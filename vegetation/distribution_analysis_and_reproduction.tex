\section{Plant Distribution Analysis and Reproduction} \label{sec:dist_analysis_and_rep}

As mentioned previously, running a simulation using the ecosystem simulator to generate valid plant distributions can be a lengthy process (see section \ref{subsec:ecosytem_performance}). This processing time depends on the plant count and the resolution of the simulation window. The simulation illustrated in figure \ref{fig:ecosimulator_test_plant_count}, for example, took four and a half minutes to run.\\

The area to cover with vegetation on the terrain, and therefore for which valid plant distributions need to be created, can potentially be much larger than the hundred by hundred metre simulation window used by ecosystem simulator. There are three obvious ways the ecosystem simulator could be used to generate vegetation for larger areas: \textit{Setting the simulation window to the area which must be covered}, \textit{decreasing the resolution of the simulation window} and by \textit{repeating the output of the hundred by hundred metre distribution (tiling)}. Each come with major setbacks, however, as \textit{increasing the simulation} window will further increase the processing time, \textit{decreasing the resolution} would impact the resulting realism and \textit{tiling} would create repetitive vegetation, also impacting the resulting realism.\\

In this work, \textit{radial distribution analysis} is used, inspired by the work by Emilien et al. \cite{Emilien} to analyse the statistical characteristics of the vegetation distribution generated by the ecosystem simulator. This analysis data is then used to generate plausible distributions on much larger areas that respect the characteristics of these input exemplars. This method proves to be both efficient as statistical reproduction runs much faster than the ecosystem simulator and realistic as it increases the area for which a plausible, non-repeated distribution is created, therefore drastically limiting any tiling on the final terrain.\\

\subsection{Radial Distribution Analysis} \label{subsec:radial_dist_analysis}

\textit{Radial distribution analysis}, as described in detail in section \ref{subsec:prob_placement_radial_dist}, is performed on the output of the ecosystem simulator to grasp its core characteristics. When performing the analysis on the vegetation distribution output of the ecosystem simulator, each plant instance acts as a single point and the different species represent the individual categories. Customizations to the generic radial distribution analysis algorithm are performed, as discussed below, to better suit the purpose of analysing plant distributions.

\paragraph{Generating the category hierarchy}

During the reproduction phase, distributions for each category are created sequentially, in order of priority. Once a valid distribution is created for a given category, it is static and \textbf{does not} change whilst points of other categories are being plotted. For this reason, the category hierarchy plays a vital role and has a big impact on the final distribution. A side effect of this hierarchical approach is that pair-correlation histograms do not need to be generated for each category pair combinations but only for combinations for which the target category is under or equal to the source category in the priority hierarchy. Because taller plants will potentially have a canopy which shades and influences the position of smaller plants, it is important these be generated first during reproduction. For this reason, the hierarchy is generated based on the average height of the represented plant specie, in descending order.

\paragraph{Category Dependency Analysis}

Shade-loving plants will appear under the the shaded canopies of taller plants (see section \ref{subsec:ecosystem_simulator_results}). To cater for this during radial distribution analysis, a new \textit{negative histogram bin} is created for plants that appear within the canopy radius of others.\\

During reproduction, the taller plants will be placed first because they are classed higher in the category hierarchy. This does not guarantee all shade-loving plants will be placed in the shaded canopy of other plants, however, as if a shade-loving plant is placed at a distance larger than \textit{R$_{max}$} to any other plant instance, it is attributed a strength of one by default and is therefore deemed valid. It is essential to attribute a strength of one in such condition to permit plant propagation. A solution to this problem would be to make \textit{R$_{max}$} large enough to cover the entire simulation window. This would drastically increase the computational resources, however. Another solution is used here: When the pairwise histograms have been generated for a given category \textit{A}, they are subsequently analysed to check whether or not all instances appear within the \textit{negative-bin} of the other category. The specie \textit{A} is deemed \textbf{dependent} on all categories for which this is true and, during reproduction, will have to be placed within the radius of one of them for the distribution to be valid.

\paragraph{Point-size Analysis}

Plant size, as well as locations, is an important property of the output of the ecosystem simulator. In order to reproduce appropriately sized plants, this must also be analysed. To do so, the \textit{minimum} and \textit{maximum} canopy radius and height for each category are analysed. When placing plants of the given category during the reproduction phase, its size is selected at random within the range [\textit{minimum},\textit{maximum}]. A valuable addition to this work which could improve the realism of the results would be to also generate binned histograms for the plant sizes, which would subsequently be used to generate plant sizes matching the input exemplar more closely.\\

\paragraph{Configuration Parameters}

The \textit{radial distribution analysis} requires the following configuration parameters: \textit{R$_{min}$}, \textit{R$_{min}$} and \textit{bin-size}. Details on each parameter can be found in section \ref{subsec:prob_placement_radial_dist}.\\

Increasing the analysis range [\textit{R$_{min}$}, \textit{R$_{max}$}] and decreasing the \textit{bin-size} will impact performance but potentially increase the accuracy of the analysis and finding optimal values for these parameters depends on the properties of the points being analysed. It is unnecessary to have too large of an analysis range as the impact a plant has on it's surrounding is finite. This impact radius varies however and is dependent on specie size. In order to cater for different species of different sizes and therefore with different impact radii, R$_{max}$ is dynamic and limited to \textbf{two metres} passed the extremity of the plant's canopy.\\
The bin-size doesn't influence performance as severely as the analysis range, however, as it has no impact on the number of points that need to be processed but only the bin in which they will influence. Smaller bin sizes will result in less points being processed per bin and, therefore, a less accurate representation of the distribution variation with distance. Because smaller bins will result in a smaller number of points, also, the analysis will be more sensitive to noise. A bin size of \textbf{twenty centimetres} is used as it strikes a good balance between accuracy and point count per bin. All these parameters can easily be changed, however, if the generated analysis data is considered ill-suited by the user. \\

\paragraph{Performance}

In order to generate the necessary analysis data, each point (plant) must be iterated over and the distance measured from it to all other points within a radius of \textit{R$_{max}$}. As a consequence, the analysis time is directly correlated to plant density and, therefore, plant count within the hundred metre analysis window. To determine the correlation between plant density and analysis time, test distributions are generated of various densities using the ecosystem simulator, which are subsequently analysed and the time to do so, measured. Because the number of histograms that need to be generated depends on the number of categories to be analysed, one would easily assume that the processing time is also correlated to the category count. This is \textbf{not} the case however as it does not affect the aggregate point count that needs to be process. Only point density influences analysis performance and to demonstrate this, the various plant densities are generated containing one, two and three distinct categories. The results, plotted in figure \ref{fig:analysis_perf}, indicate an exponential correlation between plant count and processing time and even point to a quicker analysis time when points are split into multiple categories. The processing is faster when split into multiple categories because multi-threading is used to generate the different pair correlation histograms in parallel. Although the correlation is exponential, the most extreme scenario (over ninety thousand points of a single category) is processed in a manageable time of just under two seconds. \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Radial Distribution Reproduction}

The purpose of the analysed radial distribution data is to later use it to reproduce distributions on larger scales which match the characteristics of the original input exemplars from the ecosystem simulator. To do so, the same reproduction technique described in section \ref{subsec:prob_placement_radial_dist} is employed with slight nuances described below.

\paragraph{Matched Density Initialization}

Rather than employ a birth-and-death technique like that described in section \ref{subsec:prob_placement_radial_dist} and employed in the work by Emilien et al. \cite{Emilien}, where a point is added, the aggregate strength of the distribution calculated and the new point accepted with a calculated probability, matched-density initialization is employed. This technique first initializes the distribution with a fixed number of points so that the point density matches that of the input exemplar. The only requirement is for the aggregate strength of the distribution to be non-zero. In other words, the distribution does not need to be strongly matched, but valid. Matched-density initialization is performed to ensure the plant density of the reproduction matches that of the input exemplar as this is deemed a vital property of vegetative state.\\

\paragraph{Iterative Point Moving} 

When points of a given category have been initialized and the required density reached, iterative point-moving is performed where each point is iterated over and moved to two randomly locations. The new distribution strength is calculated after each move and the best scoring move is accepted with probability \textit{P$_{acceptance}$}, calculated using equation \ref{eq:reproduction_probability_acceptance}. Although more than two random moves could be attempted for each point, it has a big impact on performance. Two has been selected through trial-and-error as it strikes a good balance between performance and resulting realism. Like other configuration parameters, however, this value can easily be modified to improve realism at the cost of processing speed. A possible extension to this work would be to make the number of trial moves per point dynamic depending on the total point count in the distribution. \\

\begin{equation}
\centering
P_{acceptance} = \frac{Strength_{n+1}}{Strength_{n}}
\label{eq:reproduction_probability_acceptance}
\end{equation}
Where:\textit{Strength$_{n+1}$} is the aggregated distribution strength after the move; \textit{Strength$_{n}$} is the aggregated distribution strength before the move.

\paragraph{Performance}

The reproduction area and point density are two properties which greatly affect performance as both effect the number of points to reproduce and, therefore, the reproduction time. Because an decrease in plant density leads to less points within R$_{max}$ of any given source point, perfromance should increase with reproduction area if the plant count is kept fixed and plant locations span the entirety of the analysis window. To determine to what extent and the correlation between plant density, reproduction area and performance, test reproductions are performed using the analysis data generated when performance testing the analysis stage (section \ref{subsec:radial_dist_analysis}).\\

Figure \ref{fig:reproduction_density_area_perf} plots the reproduction performance based on point density for various reproduction areas. It shows the correlation between plant density and reproduction time to be exponential and the exponential increase more severe when reproducing larger areas. This is expected, however, as larger areas will require more points to be added in order to meet the required density. The most extreme test scenario is to reproduce a distribution with an original density of 85530 for 10'000 m$^{2}$ over an area of 250'000 m$^{2}$. To do so, this test had to place over 50 million points and took 138 seconds to do so.\\

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{radial_distribution_reproduction_area_and_density_perf.png}
	\caption{ Reproduction time based on point density for different reproduction areas.}	
	\label{fig:reproduction_density_area_perf}
\end{figure}

Using the test data generated to plot figure \ref{fig:reproduction_density_area_perf}, it is possible to plot the reproduction time based solely on plant count for various densities (see figure \ref{fig:reproduction_plant_count_perf}). It shows the correlation between plant count and reproduction time to be linear and dependent on point density. The reason it is sensitive to plant density is because the denser the points are the the more of them will be within a distance of R$_{max}$ and, therefore, need to be taken into consideration when calculating the strength of the distribution. Based on this, in order to keep reproduction times manageable irrespective of point density (under a minute), the total reproduced plant count is limited to half a million. If large areas need to be reproduced with a plant count higher than this limit, repeating/tiling is performed. Appendix \ref{AppendixC} outlines the maximum reproduction areas that can be achieved, given this limitation, for different plant densities. Although the repetition (tiling) performed will increase for denser distributions, it will not necessarily be more noticeable as denser distributions will tend to have less distinct patterns and be more closely correlated to random.\\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Caching Distribution Data}

In order to prevent repeated costly runs of the ecosystem simulator for identical resource parameters, the analysed distribution data is stored and tracked in a database. This way, if a plant distribution is requested for a simulation which has already been run, the ecosystem simulator is bypassed entirely and the stored distribution data used. A custom binary file format is used in order to save space when storing the necessary distribution analysis data.

\subsection{Results}

The important properties of the input exemplars which must be reproduced are: \textit{inter and intra specie separation}, \textit{plant size} and \textit{specie densities}. To ensure these are accurately reproduced, an ecosystem simulator run is performed containing \textit{shade-loving}, \textit{shade intolerant} and \textit{canopy plants}. The resulting plant distribution is subsequently used as input exemplar to stress test the distribution analyser and reproducer. Figure \ref{fig:radial_dist_test} shows an overview and zoomed subsection of the input exemplar along with it's associated reproduction. From this, along with the point count of individual species, it is possible to conclude that point density and point size is accurately replicated. To determine whether intra and inter-specie spacing is accurately reproduced, the reproduction distribution is re-analysed in order to produce the pair correlation histograms of the reproduced distribution. The original and reproduced histograms are then compared to ensure they follow similar trends (see figure \ref{fig:hisogram_comp}). Important properties to note which are accurately reproduced are:
\begin{itemize}
\item No plants appear within the radius of the shade-loving (category 6) and shade-intolerant plants (category 5)
\item The density of shade-intolerant plants (category 5) drastically decreases within the radius of canopy plants (category 9).
\item The density of shade-loving plants (category 6) drastically decreases within the radius of canopy plants (category 9). Note that in both the original and reproduction, all shade-loving plants appear within the radius of a canopy plants as the categories are dependent. The variation in histogram values between the two is caused by the positioning of other nearby canopy plants.
\item The density decreases drastically for canopy plants within the canopy of other canopy plants (category 9) as it blocks access to available illumination.
\end{itemize}

Note that the pair correlation histogram of the shade-loving specie with itself (category 6 and 6) is substantially different between original and reproduction. The reason for this is because during the ecosystem simulator, seeding is performed from existing plant instances which will lead to the clustering of plants under the same canopy. During iterative point-moving, the probability of shade-loving plants to cluster under neighbouring canopy plants is very slim, however, and dispersion under all present canopy plants is much more likely.
