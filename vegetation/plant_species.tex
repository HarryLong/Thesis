\section{Plant Species}

A database is used to store all plant species and their associated properties. The associated properties are used to determine their ability to grow in given environments and, subsequently, deduce a plausible distribution using the ecosystem simulator. Details about these properties and how they can be edited and new species added is discussed in \textit{Specie Properties} and  \textit{Storing Species} respectively.
